# KRSSG Task Round

---

## Task 1
 - The files of task one are in the task1 folder above. 
 - The task1 folder has its own readme file containing all the info related to it.

## Task 2
 - Files are in the task2 folder
 - folder has its own readme file containing all the req info.

## Task3
 - Files of task3 part 1 are in the task 3 folder and I had done all the commits in the task 3 brancha and not in main brach so you can see them there.
 - And readme file of task 3 is in its folder.

I was only able to perform these tasks properly and other I have not even touched. Because I wanted to go in order and hence I did my best in these above tasks. And as of now I think I could have done much more if either half or a week would have been provided after midsem. Bcus then I would have invested a much greater part of the say in doing the tasks.
