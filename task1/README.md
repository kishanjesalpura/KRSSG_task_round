### How to run the programme?

 - I have not used any modules/libraries outside that of python's default provided modules.
 - Not that this programme will work on python version 3.5 and above
 - To run the programme just run the casino.py programme in the terminal.
 - After the 4 rounds are over every client will be asked wether it wants to continue the game.
 - If all clients agree then only the server will conitnue.
 - Else the server will exit as well as all the clients.

### For the bonus files.
 - There are three files with a name bonus in them.
 - The casino bonus is the file for the bonus part of casino server.
 - The client bonus is the file for bonus part client. (but there is no specific change in the client and the client bonus file.)
 - The client_1_bonus.py is the file which will be used to connect to the casino_bonus server in order to enter the number of player and the rounds to be played in the server.
 - **while running the bonus server and client**
 - Run the server first.
 - Then run client_1_bonus in another terminal.
 - Enter the number of players and the total number of rounds.
 - Then open all the client terminals and the game is on.
