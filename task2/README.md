# Task2
## FSM dynamic signal handling machine

---

### How to run?
 - No extra modules used.
 - For the normal question just run the FSM_signal.py file.
 - **For the bonus part of the question** first run the FSM_client_bonus.py file.
 - Then open the FSM_bonus_client.py file in 4 terminals (new windows or tabs).
 - Each FSMclient will ask you which road is it.
 - Enter the letter of the road in capitals.
 - Then enter the traffic incoming in each timestamp.
 - Here the server(FSM_signal_bonus.py) prints the signals in its terminal as well as sends the signals to corresponding clients.
 - The cycle of sending the signals continues and finally the server exits as well as all the clients when the traffic is zero.
 - **plz consider the final commit** because i had already had that idea during the mid interviews and was not able to apply it in code due to time constraints due to assignments and homework.(and some other personel matters)
 - the final FSM code is the real fsm code as far as I understood during mid interviews.
